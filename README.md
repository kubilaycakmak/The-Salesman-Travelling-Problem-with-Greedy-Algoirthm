# The-Salesman-Travelling-Problem-with-Greedy-Algoirthm

The Greedy Algorithm should find sortest edge to take home and It will starting from that Vertex,
After that, It should find the sort edge to contiue travelling.

We know, Greedy Algorithm is not effient and right way for all probability.
It wont take all edges and calculate them to find sortest path to travel for all permutation.

Hope it will help you out!
